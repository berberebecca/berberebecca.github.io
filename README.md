# Insulin prices in the United States

In this work I wanted to show the extreme high cost of insulin in the US\
the development of such price over time and the comparison to other countries.

I used data from Rand Health Care, collected data for the US government on insulin price
comparisons between the US and other countries. For the "development-over-time" data, I used information from the Health Care Cost Institute. Other information for the
article also came from a scientific journal (linked in the article), various diabetes information outlets
and the CDC.

I analyzed the data by converting the pdfs, in which the information was stored, into Excel files and then
used pandas to create dataframes, tables and the first graphs, to have an idea of what the final visuals could 
look like.

The most challenging part was embedding the ai2html graph onto the page and in general make the scrollytelling work.
I feel like I have a way better understanding of html now. I wished this project contained a bit more
of a scraping part but that will be my aim for the next project.
